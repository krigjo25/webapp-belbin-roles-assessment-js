# Belbin Roles Assingment
This repository contains the source code for a web-based application designed to assess and visualize Belbin Team Role preferences.<br>
Utilizing the established Belbin Team Role model, the application provides users with a comprehensive self-assessment experience,<br>
culminating in a detailed analysis of their preferred team roles.

The primary goal of this project is to create an accessible and user-friendly tool for individuals and teams to gain insights into<br>
their team dynamics based on the Belbin framework. By completing a structured questionnaire, users receive personalized feedback,<br>
highlighting their potential contributions and preferred roles within a team setting.Â <br>
